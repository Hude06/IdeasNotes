#Ideal Notes App

A notes app should be simple, It should have everything you need and nothing more, I have had a pain with notes apps before. Not saving my work or having to switch back and forth between platforms. Thats why I made the Ideal Notes App

#Why I chose JS
So I had been thinking about what language I wanted to code this in and thought why not Javascript.

#Tauri
So I chose Tauri over Electron for many reasons. One of the first is that Tauri is just newer, Easier to set up and is overall just faster. It also has a much smaller package size. Sence it doesent embend a version of chrom in your app, it just uses what ever you already have installed.
